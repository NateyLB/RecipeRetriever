# RecipeRetriever
The start of our repo.
The goalis to create a simple app that is powered by a LLM
MVP is to create an application with a UI that can ingest ingredients or natural English sentences and retrieve real recipes that use those ingredients from sources such as New York Times, Allrecipes, obscure food blogs, and any other reliable sources. 
The goal is to not generate recipes, but to find recipes that are real and grounde.
